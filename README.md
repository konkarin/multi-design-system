# Multi Framework Design System (Sample)

This is a multi-framework design system built to support both **React** and **Vue** applications. The system leverages the power of **Ark UI** and **Radix UI** to create accessible, customizable, and reusable components that can be shared across projects using different front-end frameworks.
